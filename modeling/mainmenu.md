# Save/Import/Export

The main file menu is located in the top-left corner of the screen, offering quick access to essential file management commands. The menu provides the following options:  

## Menu Options  

### Save
This option allows you to immediately save the current file. It ensures that your changes are preserved without any delay.  

### Toggle Autosave
By default, autosave is enabled to automatically save your file at regular intervals. If the file becomes too large, autosave may be disabled. You can toggle the autosave feature on or off for the current session, overriding the default behavior.  

### Import
The Import option opens a file dialogue, allowing you to import `.OBJ` and `.Amesh` files into your current project. This feature helps integrate external assets or previously saved projects seamlessly into your workspace.  

### Export 
The Export option allows you to create an `.OBJ` model file or generate a Zip file containing the `.OBJ`, `.MTL`, and texture files. This option always exports all objects within the current file, ensuring that everything youâ€™ve worked on is included in the export.  

### Exit 
Selecting Exit will save your file immediately and return you to the File Explorer screen. This ensures that all progress is preserved before exiting the current session.
