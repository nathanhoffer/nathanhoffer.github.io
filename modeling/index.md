# Modeling Mode Overview  

Modeling Mode is the primary workspace in ArtiMesh, automatically opening when you load a file. It is designed for modifying meshes and positioning them within 3D space, offering powerful tools for precise editing and transformations.  

## Edit Modes  
At the top of the screen, youâ€™ll find options to select the type of edit mode:  
- **Object Mode:** Modify entire objects, including their transformations and positions.  
- **Vertex Mode:** Edit individual vertices for detailed adjustments.  
- **Edge Mode:** Work with edges to refine the shape and structure of your meshes.  
- **Face Mode:** Adjust and manipulate entire faces for broader modifications.  

**Note:** A vertex always belongs to an edge, which in turn always belongs to a face. No orphaned vertices or edges can exist, ensuring the integrity of your 3D mesh.  

Each mode unlocks unique selection and modification commands tailored to the chosen edit level, ensuring versatility for all modeling tasks.  

## Transformation Tools  
In the top-left corner below the menu bar, there are three transformation tool icons:  
- **Move:** Allows you to reposition selected elements within 3D space.  
- **Scale:** Adjusts the size of the selected elements proportionally or along specific axes.  
- **Rotate:** Enables rotation of selected elements to achieve precise orientations.  

When a transformation tool is active, handles specific to that tool will appear on the selected object or element. These handles make it easy to apply transformations accurately.
