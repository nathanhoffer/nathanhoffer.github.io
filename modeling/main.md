# Main Controls  

In addition to the core tools in Modeling Mode, ArtiMesh provides several other essential controls to enhance your workflow. These tools help you manage your 3D projects with precision and flexibility.  

## Dropdown for Changing ArtiMesh Mode  
At the top of the screen, you’ll find a dropdown menu that allows you to switch between different modes in ArtiMesh. The available modes include:  
- **Modeling (Default):** The primary mode for mesh modification and object placement.  
- **Sculpting:** A mode focused on freeform sculpting, ideal for creating organic shapes and detailed surfaces.  
- **Materials:** Manage and assign materials to your models.  
- **UV Mapping:** Unwrap and map textures to your 3D model.  
- **Texture Painting:** Paint directly onto your 3D model’s surface, applying textures and details.  
- **Rendering:** Switch to rendering mode to finalize your scene and produce high-quality images or animations.  

Switching between these modes allows you to focus on specific aspects of your project, making the process more efficient and organized.  

## Edit Modes  
At the top of the screen, you’ll find options to select the type of edit mode:  
- **Object Mode:** Modify entire objects, including their transformations and positions.  
- **Vertex Mode:** Edit individual vertices for detailed adjustments.  
- **Edge Mode:** Work with edges to refine the shape and structure of your meshes.  
- **Face Mode:** Adjust and manipulate entire faces for broader modifications.  

**Note:** A vertex always belongs to an edge, which in turn always belongs to a face. No orphaned vertices or edges can exist, ensuring the integrity of your 3D mesh.  

Each mode unlocks unique selection and modification commands tailored to the chosen edit level, ensuring versatility for all modeling tasks.  

## Transformation Tools  
In the top-left corner below the menu bar, there are three transformation tool icons:  
- **Move:** Allows you to reposition selected elements within 3D space.  
- **Scale:** Adjusts the size of the selected elements proportionally or along specific axes.  
- **Rotate:** Enables rotation of selected elements to achieve precise orientations.  

When a transformation tool is active, handles specific to that tool will appear on the selected object or element. These handles make it easy to apply transformations accurately.  

## Rectangular Select Button 
The Rectangular Select tool enables you to select multiple objects, faces, vertices, or edges by drawing a rectangular selection box. This feature allows for quick and efficient selection of a range of elements at once, improving workflow speed when working with complex models.  

## Focus Button
The Focus tool zooms in on the currently selected object or elements, adjusting the view so they fit comfortably within the screen. This feature is helpful for focusing on a specific area of your model, ensuring detailed work can be done without distractions from the rest of the scene.
