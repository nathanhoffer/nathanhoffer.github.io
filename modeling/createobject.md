- **Size Z:** The height of the prism along the Z-axis.  

### Plane  
A flat surface that can be subdivided.  
- **Width:** The size of the plane along the X-axis.

- **Height Divisions:** The number of subdivisions along the height.  

### Cylinder/Pipe  
A cylindrical or hollow pipe-like shape.  
- **Radius:** The distance from the center to the outer edge.  
- **Height:** The size of the cylinder along the Z-axis.  
- **Axis Divisions:** The number of segments around the circumference.  
- **Height Divisions:** The number of segments along the height.  
- **Pipe Wall Thickness (0 for cylinder):** Defines the thickness of the pipe walls. A value of 0 creates a solid cylinder.  

### Arch  
A curved structure or arc.  
- **Angle:** The total angle of the arch.  
- **Radius:** The distance from the center to the outer edge of the arch.  
- **Width:** The thickness of the arch along the X-axis.  
- **Depth:** The thickness of the arch along the Z-axis.  
- **Radial Subdivisions:** The number of segments that define the curvature of the arch.  
- **Build Inside Faces:** Whether to include the inside surface of the arch.  
- **Build Outside Faces:** Whether to include the outside surface of the arch.  
- **Build Front Faces:** Whether to include the front-facing surface of the arch.  
- **Build Back Faces:** Whether to include the back-facing surface of the arch.  
- **Build End Faces:** Whether to include the end caps of the arch.  

### Torus  
A doughnut-shaped object.  
- **Rows:** The number of subdivisions around the outer ring.  
- **Columns:** The number of subdivisions around the inner ring.  
- **Inner Radius:** The radius of the inner ring.  
- **Outer Radius:** The distance from the center to the outer edge.  
- **Horizontal Circumference:** The proportion of the torus completed horizontally (e.g., 360Â° for a full torus).  
- **Vertical Circumference:** The proportion of the torus completed vertically.  
- **Shade Smooth:** Whether the torus should appear smooth or faceted.  

### Cone  
A conical shape tapering to a point.  
- **Radius:** The radius of the base.  
- **Height:** The height of the cone along the Z-axis.  
- **Axis Subdivisions:** The number of segments around the base of the cone.  

### Sphere  
A fully rounded 3D object.  
- **Radius:** The size of the sphere from the center to its surface.  
- **Subdivisions:** The number of segments used to create the sphere, affecting its smoothness.  

### Text  
Creates 3D text.  
- **Text:** The string value to display as the text.  
- **Font:** The font used for the text (e.g., Arial, Bodoni, Impact).  
- **Thickness:** The depth of the text along the Z-axis.  
- **Spacing:** The spacing between individual characters.  
- **Rotations:** The rotation of the text along any axis.  
- **Shear:** The slant or skew of the text.  
- **Scale:** The overall size of the text.  

### Image  
Creates a quad mesh using an image loaded from the library.  
- **Load from Library:** Opens a file selection dialog to choose an image. The selected image is applied to the quad mesh as a texture.
