# Scene View  

The Scene View button, located between the Rectangle Select and Settings buttons, opens a list of all objects in your scene. This feature allows you to manage and modify objects quickly through a streamlined interface.  

## Scene View Interface  

In the Scene View, each object in the list is displayed with the following:  
- **Thumbnail:** A small preview image of the object on the left side.  
- **Object Name:** The name of the object is displayed in the center for easy identification.  
- **Buttons:** On the right side, you'll find three buttons for each object:  
  - **Rename:** Allows you to change the name of the object.  
  - **Modify:** Opens a menu for additional object settings.  
  - **Toggle Visibility:** Enables you to hide or show the object in the scene.  The object will not be able to be selected when invisible.

### Modify Menu  
When you click the **Modify** button, you’ll be presented with options to adjust the object’s behavior in Render Mode and modify the Mirror Modifier:  

- **Cast Shadows:** Enables or disables the object’s ability to cast shadows in render mode.  
- **Receive Shadows:** Toggles whether the object can receive shadows from other objects in the scene.  
- **Mirror Modifier:** Allows you to mirror the object along the X, Y, and Z axes by selecting the corresponding checkboxes. This mirrors the object in Modeling Mode.  

**Note:** While in Mirror Modifier mode, only the non-mirrored sides of the object can be edited in the editor. This feature helps streamline modeling by focusing on one half of the object, with changes automatically reflected on the mirrored side.
