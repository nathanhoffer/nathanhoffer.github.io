# Settings  

The Settings button is located on the bottom-left side of the screen. It opens a menu for customizing various transformation and modeling preferences to suit your workflow.  

## Transform Orientation  
You can choose the orientation for the transform handles:  

- **Local:** The transform handles will either match the face's normal or the orientation of a single selected object. If multiple objects are selected, the global orientation will be used.  
- **Global:** The transform handles always match world space, regardless of the selected objectâ€™s orientation.  

## Transform Pivot  
Choose the pivot point for transformations:  

- **Center:** The transform handle will be shown in the center of the bounding box of the selection.  
- **Active Element:** The pivot point is always based on the last selected element (face, object, vertex, edge, depending on the mode).  

## X-Ray Mode  
The X-Ray Mode toggle allows you to look through objects and select elements through them while modeling. This is useful for selecting elements that may be obscured by other parts of the model.  

## Grid Size  
This setting controls how many units appear between the lines of the background grid in the 3D scene. Adjust this value to suit the scale and level of detail you are working with.  

## Incremental Snapping  
When enabled, transforms will only move by the set incremental value (from the last position, not snapping to world units). This feature ensures that transformations are precise and align with your desired step size.  
You can input specific unit snapping values for Move, Rotate, and Scale operations in the corresponding fields.  

These settings provide flexibility in your modeling process, allowing you to tailor your transformation tools and scene layout to your specific needs.
