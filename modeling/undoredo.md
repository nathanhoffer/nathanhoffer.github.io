# Undo/Redo  

The Undo and Redo buttons are located in the top-right corner of the toolbar. These buttons allow you to easily revert or reapply changes made during your current session.  

## Undo/Redo History  
- Undo and Redo operations are only available for actions made since the last time the file was opened. The history is cleared each time the file is closed and reopened.  
- The Undo and Redo buttons are interactive only when there is history available. If no actions have been made in the current session, these buttons will be inactive.  

## Gesture Shortcuts  
- You can also use **two-finger tap** to trigger the Undo action.  
- Use **three-finger tap** to trigger the Redo action.  

These features provide quick and efficient ways to manage your edits, ensuring you can easily correct mistakes or revisit previous steps in your workflow.
