# Scene Axis  

The Scene Axis control is located in the upper-right corner under the menu bar. It provides a visual representation of the X, Y, and Z axes, displaying the current rotation of your view in the 3D space.  

## Axis Indicators  
The Scene Axis shows the X, Y, and Z rotations of the current camera view. Each axis is color-coded for easy identification:  
- **X-axis** (red)  
- **Y-axis** (green)  
- **Z-axis** (blue)  

## Snap to View  
Tapping on any of the axis indicators will snap the camera to that specific view:  
- **Side View** (X-axis)  
- **Front View** (Y-axis)  
- **Top View** (Z-axis)  

## Toggle Camera Mode  
The middle square at the origin of the Scene Axis serves as a toggle between two camera modes:  
- **Perspective Mode:** A traditional 3D view with depth and perspective.  
- **Orthographic Mode:** A flat, 2D-like view with no perspective distortion, ideal for precise modeling.  

The Scene Axis control helps you easily navigate and adjust your view, providing quick access to standard views and camera modes.
