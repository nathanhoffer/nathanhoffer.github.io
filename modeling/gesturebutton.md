# Gesture Button  

The Gesture Button, located in the lower-left corner of the screen, provides unique controls for enhancing your workflow in Modeling Mode. These gestures allow for advanced selection and manipulation of meshes, making it easier to work with complex models.  

## Multi-Select  
Holding down the Gesture Button and tapping on meshes allows you to select multiple objects or elements. This feature streamlines the selection process when working with many components in the scene.  

## Face Edit Mode  
In Face Edit Mode, holding down the Gesture Button before dragging the Move handle will extrude the currently selected faces. This is an efficient way to create additional geometry based on the selected faces, speeding up the modeling process.  

## Double, Triple, and Quadruple Tap Shortcuts  

### Object Mode  
- **Double Tap:** Selects all visible objects in the scene. If all objects are already selected, it will deselect them instead. This provides a quick way to select or deselect everything in the scene.  

### Vertex, Edge, Face Modes  
- **Double Tap:** Selects all connected elements (vertices, edges, or faces) in the current mode. If no elements are currently selected, nothing will happen. This allows you to quickly select an entire connected mesh structure.  

### Edge Mode  
- **Triple Tap:** Selects the **Edge Loop**, which is a continuous loop of edges running along the surface of the model. This is helpful for making adjustments to a specific loop of edges.  
- **Quadruple Tap:** Selects the **Edge Ring**, which is a set of edges that run perpendicular to the edge loop. This is useful for selecting a broader area of edges to modify.  

### Face Mode  
- **Triple Tap:** Selects the **Face Loop**, which is a continuous loop of faces along the surface of the mesh. This allows you to modify an entire loop of faces at once.  
- **Quadruple Tap:** Selects the **Face Ring**, which is a set of faces running perpendicular to the face loop. This enables you to select and manipulate a wider area of faces for editing.  

These gesture-based shortcuts provide a fast and efficient way to navigate and edit your models in different modes, improving productivity and precision during the modeling process.
