# Welcome to Docsify Page!

This site was created using [**Docsify**](https://docsify.js.org), which is an open source documentation site generator, and imported in GitHub page. This site was created for [**PureSourceCode.com**](https://www.puresourcecode.com/) demo.

## Feature
In this template for Docsify, you have the basic implementation plus few plugins:

- Full index search. This plugin ignores diacritical marks when performing a full text search (e.g., "cafe" will also match "caf√©"). Legacy browsers like IE11 require the following [String.normalize()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/normalize) polyfill library to ignore diacritical marks
- Zoom on images
- Pagination
- Reading progress bar
- Mermaid
