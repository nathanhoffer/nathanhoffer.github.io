# Material Actions  

Material Actions provide tools for managing materials within the scene. These actions allow you to create new materials, assign them to objects or faces, and delete materials no longer needed.  

## Actions  

### New Material  
- Creates a new material and adds it to the scene. The material is initially untitled and must be customized through Material Properties.  

### Delete Material  
- Permanently removes the selected material from the scene.  
- If the material is applied to any objects or faces, those areas will revert to a default material.  

### Assign Material  
- Applies the selected material to the active selection:  
  - In **Object Mode**, the material is assigned to the entire object.  
  - In **Vertex, Edge, or Face Modes**, the material is applied to the selected faces only.  

### Select Material  
- Highlights areas of the mesh where the material is applied:  
  - In **Object Mode**, selects objects using the material.  
  - In **Vertex, Edge, or Face Modes**, selects all faces with the material applied.
