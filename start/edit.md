# Edit Files  

Long-pressing a thumbnail in the File Explorer reveals additional action buttons that allow you to manage your files efficiently. Each button provides a specific function to enhance your workflow.  

## Action Buttons  

### Delete
The Delete button permanently removes the selected file from your library. To prevent accidental deletion, a confirmation prompt will appear, asking you to confirm before the file is deleted.  

### Duplicate 
The Duplicate button creates an exact copy of the selected file. The duplicated file will have the same name as the original, with a numerical suffix added to indicate the next version (e.g., `Project 1`, `Project 2`). This feature is ideal for version control or creating alternate design iterations.  

### Share 
The Share button allows you to export the selected file in `.amesh` format. This format is compatible with ArtiMesh and can be shared or imported into other devices or instances of the app. Sharing makes collaboration and backup straightforward and seamless.  

### Rename
The Rename button enables you to give the file a new name. This feature helps you organize your projects more effectively by using descriptive or meaningful filenames.
