# Search/Sort Files

The Search and Sort features at the top of the File Explorer provide efficient tools to help you quickly locate and organize your files.  

## Search Bar  
The search bar allows you to find files by their filename. This feature updates results dynamically as you type, ensuring an instant and seamless search experience without needing to press a submit button.  

### How it Works  
- Start typing in the search bar, and the displayed files will filter in real-time based on your input.  
- The dynamic filtering ensures that only files matching your search query are visible, making it easy to locate specific projects.  

## Sorting Dropdown  
Next to the search bar is a dropdown menu that lets you sort files according to different criteria. This allows you to organize files in a way that suits your workflow.  

### Sorting Options  
- **Last Modified:** Displays files in order of the most recently edited to the oldest.  
- **Created Date:** Lists files by their creation date, from newest to oldest.  
- **File Name:** Organizes files alphabetically for easy browsing.  
- **File Size:** Sorts files from largest to smallest, helping you identify large projects.  

By combining the search and sort features, you can efficiently navigate your library, even with a large number of files.
