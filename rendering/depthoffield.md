# Depth of Field  

Depth of Field (DoF) simulates the focus effect found in photography, blurring objects outside the focal point. You can adjust the following:

- **Focus Distance:** Set the distance at which objects are in sharp focus.
- **Aperture:** Adjust the size of the lens aperture, affecting the blur effect.
- **Focal Length:** Control the zoom level for the depth of field effect.
- **Max Blur Size:** Choose between Small, Medium, Large, or Very Large blur effects for out-of-focus areas.

This effect adds a realistic cinematic quality to your renders by focusing attention on specific areas.
