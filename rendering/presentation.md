# Presentation Mode  

Presentation Mode minimizes the user interface and automatically rotates the scene to showcase your objects. This mode is perfect for creating a dynamic, visually engaging display of your work without distractions from the UI. It allows the scene to rotate continuously, offering a cinematic view of your models or project.
