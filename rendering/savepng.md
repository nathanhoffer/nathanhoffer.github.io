# Save PNG  

The Save PNG button allows you to export your scene as a PNG file. Once your render settings are adjusted, clicking this button generates a high-resolution image of the scene that you can share or use for further purposes. The PNG file retains all applied effects and settings, ensuring your final output looks polished and ready for presentation.
