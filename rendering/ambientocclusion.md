# Ambient Occlusion  

Ambient Occlusion (AO) adds depth and realism by simulating how light interacts with the surfaces in your scene. You can adjust the following:

- **Intensity:** Control the strength of the shadowing effect.
- **Thickness:** Modify the thickness of the shadows.
- **Color:** Set the color of the occlusion effect.
- **Ambient Only:** Toggle the effect to apply only ambient light shadows.

This effect enhances the realism of your scene by adding soft shadows in crevices and corners.
