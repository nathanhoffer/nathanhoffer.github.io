# Bloom  

Bloom simulates the glowing effect that happens when bright lights in your scene spill over the edges. Adjust the following settings:

- **Intensity:** The strength of the bloom effect.
- **Threshold:** The brightness level at which the bloom effect kicks in.
- **Soft Knee:** Adjusts the transition between the threshold and the full bloom effect.
- **Clamp:** Limits the bloom to a certain brightness level.
- **Diffusion:** Controls how spread out the bloom effect is.
- **Ana Ratio:** Adjusts the balance between different light intensities.
- **Color:** Set the bloom's color for a more stylized effect.

This effect helps give your scene a more cinematic look with glowing highlights.
