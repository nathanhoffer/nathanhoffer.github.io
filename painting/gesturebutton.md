# Gesture Button  

In Texture Painting Mode, the Gesture Button provides enhanced control over your camera and painting actions.  

## How It Works  

When using the Gesture Button in Texture Painting Mode, the following features are available:

- **Camera Control:**  
  By default in texture paint mode, dragging outside of the object allows you to move the camera around.  
  - **Inside the Object:** You can drag to paint on the surface directly.  

- **Gesture Button Hold:**  
  - When the Gesture Button is held down, camera movement is disabled.  
  - This ensures that only painting actions are allowed, preventing accidental camera adjustments while working on details.

- **Gesture Shortcuts Disabled:**  
  All other gestures (such as multiselect or transformation) are disabled while the Gesture Button is held, ensuring focus on texture painting.

The Gesture Button helps you maintain precision in your work and streamlines your workflow by allowing easy control of painting and the camera simultaneously.
