# Paint Tool Dropdown  

The Paint Tool Dropdown provides options for applying and modifying textures directly on your model.  

## Tools  

### Paint  
- Applies color directly to the surface of the object.  

### Erase (White)  
- Erases by painting over with a pure white color.  

### Erase (Transparent)  
- Erases by making the painted area transparent, reverting it to the base material color.  

These tools allow for flexible editing and refinement of your textures.
