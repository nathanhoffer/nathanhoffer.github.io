# Focus  

The Focus tool in Texture Painting Mode centers the view on the last object painted.  

## How It Works  
- After painting on an object, press the Focus button to automatically adjust the camera view.  
- Ensures that the painted object is fully visible on the screen, making it easier to continue painting or editing.
