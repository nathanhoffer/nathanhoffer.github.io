# Parameters  

The Parameters section provides sliders for adjusting the brush properties during painting.  

## Radius  
- Controls the size of the brush.  
- Larger radii cover more surface area but reduce precision.  

## Hardness  
- Adjusts the softness of the brush edges.  
- High hardness creates sharp edges, while low hardness produces smoother transitions.
