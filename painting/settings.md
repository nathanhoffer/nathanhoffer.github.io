# Settings  

Texture Painting Settings let you customize the behavior of your brush and painting tools for more control and precision.  

## Options  

### Stylus Sensitivity  
- When enabled, painting will be affected by the pressure sensitivity of the Apple Pencil or any other support stylus.  If disabled, pressure is ignored.

### Paint Shape  
- **Flat:** Keeps the paint confined to a single face, preventing it from wrapping around edges. Useful for detailed face-specific painting.  
- **Sphere:** Allows smooth transitions of paint around edges and corners, ideal for creating seamless designs.
