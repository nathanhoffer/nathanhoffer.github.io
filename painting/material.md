# Material Dropdown  

The Material Dropdown lets you select which material to paint on. Only one material can be painted at a time.  

## How It Works  
- The dropdown displays a list of all materials assigned to the object.  
- Matches the material list available in Material Mode.  
- Once a material is selected, only the areas of the object using that material will be paintable.  

This ensures precise and efficient texture painting for complex models with multiple materials.
