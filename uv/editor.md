# UV Editor  

The UV Editor is a 2D workspace where you can view and edit the UV coordinates of your 3D objects. It allows precise control over how textures are applied to your model.  

## How It Works  
1. **Object Selection:** Select an object outside the UV Editor using standard selection tools.  
2. **UV Selection:** Inside the UV Editor, you can select and manipulate the UVs of the active object.  

## Transform Handles  
Use the 2D transform handles in the UV Editor to adjust the selected UVs:  
- **Move:** Drag the UV coordinates to reposition them.  
- **Scale:** Resize the UVs to better fit the texture layout.  
- **Rotate:** Rotate the UVs for proper alignment.  

These transformations are reflected in real-time on the 3D model, helping you visualize the texture mapping.
