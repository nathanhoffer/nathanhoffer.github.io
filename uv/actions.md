# UV Actions  

UV Actions provide tools to unwrap, organize, and reset UVs for precise texture mapping. These actions streamline the UV editing process and help align textures effectively.  

## Actions  

### UV Smart Unwrap  
- Automatically unwraps the selected object or UVs based on face angles and sizes.  
- Generates a balanced UV map for most general-use cases.  

### UV Normal Project  
- Projects selected UVs into a single layout based on combined face normals.  
- Ideal for flattening UVs of objects with uniform surfaces.  

### UV Reset to Auto  
- Resets the selected UVs to the default auto-calculated or tiled layout.  
- Useful for undoing manual UV edits.  

### Select UV Group  
- Available in Vertex, Edge, and Face Modes.  
- Selects all UVs that were projected together as a group, maintaining their original layout.  

### Select Auto UVs  
- Available in Vertex, Edge, and Face Modes.  
- Selects UVs that have not been manually unwrapped or edited.  

### Background Texture  
- Sets the background image displayed in the UV Editor.  
- Useful for aligning UVs to an existing texture.  

### Zoom to Fit  
- Resets the zoom and position of the UV Editor to center the UV layout.  
- Default position is between (0,0) and (1,1).
