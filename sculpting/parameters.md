# Sculpt Parameters  

The sculpting tools in ArtiMesh are customizable through two adjustable sliders:  

## Radius  
- Defines the size of the sculpting brush.  
- A larger radius affects a broader area, ideal for large-scale edits.  

## Power  
- Determines the strength of the sculpting effect.  
- Higher power applies more dramatic changes with each stroke.  

Adjust these parameters dynamically to achieve precise control over your sculpting.
