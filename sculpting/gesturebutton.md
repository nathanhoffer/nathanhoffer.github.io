# Gesture Button  

In Sculpting Mode, the **Gesture Button** enables a seamless sculpting experience by locking the camera's movement and disabling all other gestures.  

## Default Behavior  
- Dragging inside the object allows sculpting.  
- Dragging outside the object moves the camera.  

## Gesture Button Functionality  
- When the Gesture Button is held, camera movement is locked.  
- Only sculpting actions are allowed during this time.  
- All other gestures are disabled to prevent accidental adjustments.  

This feature ensures precision and uninterrupted sculpting. The Gesture Button is located in the bottom left corner of the screen.
