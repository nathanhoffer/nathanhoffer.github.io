# Focus  

The Focus feature centers the camera on the last sculpted object, making it easier to continue editing without adjusting the view manually.  

## How to Use  
- Tap the **Focus** button in the bottom right toolbar while in Sculpting Mode.  
- The camera will reposition to fit the selected object fully within the screen.  

Focus is especially useful when working on intricate details.
