# Sculpt Tools  

ArtiMesh provides a variety of tools for sculpting meshes. Each tool is designed for specific modifications:  

## Raise  
- Pushes the mesh outward from the surface, adding material to the object.  

## Lower  
- Pulls the mesh inward, removing material from the object.  

## Grab  
- Moves the mesh in the direction you drag, useful for reshaping areas.  

## Noise  
- Applies random distortions to the mesh, creating a rough or natural texture.  

## Smooth  
- Flattens and softens irregularities in the mesh for a polished appearance.
